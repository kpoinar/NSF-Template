# NSF-Template
 LaTeX template for an NSF proposal
The <a href="http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~sgille/how_to/proposal_prep.html" target="_blank">very initial version of this template</a> was created by Sarah Gille. The <a href="https://github.com/amrabed/NSF-LaTeX-Template/" target="_blank">next version of the template</a>, by Amr Abed, follows the guidelines in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg15001&org=NSF" target="_blank">NSF GPG 15-1</a>, published 2014. The current version mostly follows the previous version, but it may no longer fully comply with the earlier guidelines or even <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf24001&org=NSF" target="_blank"the current PAPPG</a>.

The key contributions of this template, above what existed already at Amr Abed's repo, are (1) that it is font-size-compatible at Research.gov (size 11.019pt Times New Roman), and (2) that the section headings are configured so that the Project Description (the meaty 15 page part of the full proposal) has its own section heading hierarchy, starting with Section 1 (Motivation) and going forward from there.  Previous versions had Summary as Section 1, Project Description as Section 2, etc. -- which I found annoying, since every heading in the Project Description was preceded by a 2.  These are now fixed, and other small improvements -- like appending ``RO'' (for Research Objective) to certain section headings, and reducing the spacing between paragraphs and section headings to save space -- are added.  Otherwise, much is unchanged from the Amr Abed version.

As said nicely by Amr Abed, it is your responsibility to make sure that everything is in agreement with the current NSF GPG and your program solicitation. Good luck!
