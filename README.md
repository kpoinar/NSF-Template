# NSF-Template
 LaTeX template for an NSF proposal
The <a href="http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~sgille/how_to/proposal_prep.html" target="_blank">very initial version of this template</a> was created by Sarah Gille. The next version of the template, by Amr Abed, follows the guidelines in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg15001&org=NSF" target="_blank">NSF GPG 15-1</a>. The current version mostly follows the previous version, but it may no longer fully comply with the earlier guidelines.

It is your responsibility to make sure that everything is in agreement with the current NSF GPG and your program solicitation. Good luck!
