\noindent\hrulefill



%Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than {\bf one page in length}. The Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity.
%The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed.  
%The Project Summary should be written in the third person, informative to other persons working in the same or related fields, and, insofar as possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically literate lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal.
%If the Project Summary contains special characters it may be uploaded as a Supplementary Document.
%{\bf Project Summaries submitted as a PDF must be formatted with separate headings for the overview, statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity}. Failure to include these headings may result in the proposal being returned without review. Additional instructions for preparation of the Project Summary are available in FastLane.\\

\subsection*{Overview:} 
\vspace{-7pt}

The key contributions of this template, above what existed already at Amr Abed's repo, are (1) that it is font-size-compatible at Research.gov (size 11.019pt Times New Roman), and (2) that the section headings are configured so that the Project Description (the meaty 15 page part of the full proposal) has its own section heading hierarchy, starting with Section 1 (Motivation) and going forward from there.  Previous versions had Summary as Section 1, Project Description as Section 2, etc. -- which I found annoying, since every heading in the Project Description was preceded by a 2.  These are now fixed, and other small improvements -- like appending ``RO'' (for Research Objective) to certain section headings, and reducing the spacing between paragraphs and section headings to save space -- are added.  Otherwise, much is unchanged from the Amr Abed version.

The proposed work does not involve Arctic fieldwork.

\subsection*{Intellectual Merit:}
\vspace{-7pt}

The statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge.

\subsection*{Broader Impacts:} 
\vspace{-7pt}

The statement on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
